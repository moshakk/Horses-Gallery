# Horses Gallery

A dynamic image gallery showcasing a collection of horse images. This project demonstrates a responsive web layout with features to switch between Grid and Masonry views.

    -   **Grid View**: Standard grid layout for uniform display.
    -   **Masonry View**: Masonry layout for a more organic feel.
-   **Image Modal**: Click on any image to view it in full size with a caption.
-   **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
